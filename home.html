	<p class="About_Me">I'm a web developer born and raised in the Philadelphia and surrounding areas. I've always been a bit of a tech whiz when it came to technology, well atleast to my family. I spent a few years in college juggling on the thought of what I wanted to do with my life. I gravitied towards alot of things but nothing as much as music and web development. Naturally I loved sports and music because that's all you were around and introduced to growing up but, my interesting for technology was different. I grew to like it not becuase of tradition and culture but because i wanted too! <span style="color: green">Go Eagles!</span> <span style="color: blue">Go Sixers!</span> <span style="color: red">Go Phillies!</span> <span style="color: orange">Go Flyers!</span> </p>
